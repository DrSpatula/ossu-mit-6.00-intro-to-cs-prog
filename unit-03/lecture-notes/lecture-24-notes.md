# Lecture 24: Avoiding Statistical Fallacies

## Statisitics don't tell the whole story!
* Enough statistics are available in a data set to pick and choose, tell any story
* Better to look at the **data itself**

## Anscombe's Data
* Four sets of data with the same mean, median and linear fit
* Each have _**vastly**_ different data distributions
* **DON'T IGNORE THE DATA**

## Pictures Can Deceive
* Axes can be selected to support a particular conclusion
* Logarithmic vs. linear axes
* Changes to the resolution of data along an axis

## Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO)
* Statistics can only be as good as the data they are drawn from

##_Cum Hoc, Ergo Procter Hoc_ Fallacy
* "With this, therefore because of this"
* Correlation is not (necessarily) causality
* The inverse conclusion would also be supported by the data
	* Going to school causes the flu / the flu causes victims to go to school
* Look for "lurking variables"
	* Some third party fact that causes both outcomes
* _Coincident effects of a common cause_

## Non Representative Sample
* Convenience sample versus a truly random sample
	* Convenience sample is sample of "close by" population and not necessarily representative of the whole
    	* example: psychology study done using on-campus students
	* A truly random sampling is more likely to be representative

## Non Response Bias
* Part of a population is not sampled, and conclusions are drawn as if that part was included
* Example: WWII airplane armor reinforcement
	* Downed planes not taken into account
	* Likely caused parts of planes that could survive hits to be reinforced over more critical areas

## Data Enhancement
* Data viewed out of context can be misleading
* Extrapolation is not always appropriate, needs to be used with reason

## Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy
* Choosing a hypothesis based on the data rather than running an experiment to test a hypothesis
* "Drawing bulls-eyes arount bullet holes"
