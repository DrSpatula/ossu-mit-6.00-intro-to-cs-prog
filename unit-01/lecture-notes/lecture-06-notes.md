# Lecture 6: Recursion

## Divide and Conquer
Algorithm where a large problem is broken into smaller parts where:
* Smaller parts are solved more easily
* Smaller problems can be combined to solve the larger problem

## Recursion
* Method of describing problems
* Method of describing solutions (a divide and conquer strategy)

A recursive definition of a problem has two parts:
### Base Case
* Has a definite answer
* Determines where the recursion will end

### Recursive Case
* Inductive part of the solution
* Reduces problem to a simpler version of the same problem and other simple operations
