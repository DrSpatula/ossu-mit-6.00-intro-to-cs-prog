# Lecture 14: Sampling and Monte Carlo Simulation

## Probability
* Can sometimes be easier to calculate the probability of something _not_ happening and subtract that value from 1
* Study of probability was motivated by the desire to understand games of chance

## Inferential Statistics
* Based on the idea that a random sample tends to exhibit the properties of the population as a whole
* **Null Hypothesis:** the result of a random occurrance
    * If the results of a simulation are far from the Null Hyptothesis, the data is likely reliable
* **The Law of Large Numbers:** In repeated, _independant_ tests with the same actual probability, **P**, of an outcome occurring, the fraction of the results with that outcome converges to **P** as the number of trials approaches infinity
    * The more trials, the closer the simulated results are to the calculated probablitiy
* Absolute certainty cannot come from sampling
