# Lecture 10: Hashing and Classes

## Hashing
* Efficient lookup, but takes more space (memory)
* Used by Python dictionaries
* Hashing creates a much smaller search space, leading to very fast lookups
* Hash functions are many to one, many values will hash to the same bucket
* Two or more values hashing to the same bucket is called a collision
* A good hash function widely distributes values amongst buckets
* Lookup time decreases as more memory is allocated to the hash table
* Table should be large enough so that lookups become O(1) (constant time)
* Any _immutable_ object can be hashed
	* If an object used for a hash key were to change, it would hash to a different value, and its corresponding value in the table would be irretrievable

### Looking Up a Value in a Hash
1. A hash function converts the value into an integer in range 0 to K
2. The integer is an index of a list of lists
3. Each sub-list is called a bucket
4. The target of the lookup will be in the list at the index returned by the hash function


## Exceptions
* Errors generated by a program at runtime
* Unhandled exceptions cause the program to crash
* Can be caught and handled by try/except blocks
* Try/except is a valid method of flow control in programs


## Classes
* Collections of data and functions that operate on that data
* A class's data and functions are collectively called its attributes
* Data and functions are both objects
* A function associated with an object is called a method
* Classes are used to introduce new types into a language
    * Can be used as easily as any built-in types
