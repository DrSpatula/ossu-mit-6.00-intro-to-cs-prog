# Lecture 16: Using Randomness to Solve Non-random Problems

## Uniform Distributions
* Each result is equally probable
* Characterized solely by the range
* Rare in nature
* Example: roll of a die, flip of a coin

## Exponential Distributions
* The only memoryless distribution
* The probability of an occurance at any timestep is independant of previous timesteps
* Exponential growth and deacay occur often in nature

## Evaluating a Model
* Fidelity and/or credibility
* Is the model accurate
* What is the utility of a model?
	* What quesions are answerable using the model
	* Simulations often have more utility
		* "What ifs?" are often answerable by tweaking the simulation
