# Lecture 11: OOP and Inheritance

## Object Oriented Programming
* Concept of OOP isn't new, about 35 years old
* Smalltalk and Clue were first to offer support for objects
* Java was first popular OOP language
* Before writing any code, determine what abstractions (types) will be useful
* Use inheritance to share code

## Classes are _Abstract Data Types_
* Describe an interface that explains _what_ an object's methods do, not _how_ they do it
* Concerned with _specification_, not _implementation_

## Data Hiding
* Users of a class have no direct access to class and instance variables
* NOT enforced by Python

## Inheritance
* Subclasses get all properties of their parent
* Subclasses can override their parent's properties
