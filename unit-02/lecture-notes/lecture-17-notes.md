# Lecture 17: Curve Fitting

## A statistically sound conclusion _is not_ truth
* Assumes the simulation was modeled correctly
* Assumes the simulation was constructed without errors
* Results need to be tested against reality
* Sanity checks are necessary
* Are results plausible

## Experimentation generally moves through the following:
1. Observation of physical reality
2. Theoretical modeling 
3. Computational modeling

## Experimental Error
* Occurs in all experiments
* Data will be randomly perturbed by errors
* Errors tend to be normally distributed
* Fitting a line or curve to a set of datapoints is a way to "correct" for error
