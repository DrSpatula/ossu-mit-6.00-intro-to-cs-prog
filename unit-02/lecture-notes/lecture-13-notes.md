# Lecture 13: Some Basic Probability and Plotting Data

## Stochastic Processes
* Process whose next state depends on the previous states plus some random element
* Many/most real-world processes are stochastic

## Randomness in Python
* Functionality comes from the `random` module
* `random.choice` function selects a random element from a colleciton
* All functions in `random` use the `random.random` function
	* Returns a float greater than zero and no greater than one

## Probability
* Expressed as what fraction of all possible results have the desired outcome
	* Value must be between 0 and 1

## Data Visualization
* Presenting the results of computation to achieve the greatest understanding
* `pylab` makes this _very easy_
* All plots of data should have titles and labled axes
