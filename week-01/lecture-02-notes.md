# Lecture 2: Core Elements of a Program

## Objects
* Everything in Python is an object
* Every object has a type
	* Type is what kind of object

## Scalar Types
* Indivisible
* _Atoms_ of a programming language

### Python Scalar Types
* Numbers
	* Integers (ints)
	* Floating point numbers (floats)
* Booleans
* None

## Expressions
* Sequence of operands and operators
* Objects are the operands
* The meaning of overloaded operators is based on the type of the operands

## Variables
* In Python, just a name given to refer to an object
* Assignment operator (=) binds a name to an object

## Program Types
### Straight Line Programs
* Series of statements executed from beginning to end
* All statements get run once
* No loops or test

### Branching Programs
* Include tests (conditional statements) to optionally execute code
* Statemens are run at most once, some not run
* No looping

### Iterative Programs
* Contain looping constructs to repeat statements

## Turing Complete Languages
* Contain both branching and looping constructs
* Able to express any program
